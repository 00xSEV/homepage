title: Deep dive into MakerDAO Endgame
---
## Lockstake
### Terms
- `nDAI` -- normalized DAI == `art`
- `<- X` -- called by a user/external entity
### What is Lockstake? 
-- Lock MKR to farm, vote, and use as collateral. 15% fee on withdrawal
    - https://endgame.makerdao.com/tokenomics/sagittarius-engine
### LockstakeClipper
- Qs
  - What is LockstakeClipper? -- Modified clipper, called by Dog (.bark)
	- [README for contest](https://github.com/makerdao/sherlock-contest/blob/9a01337e8f82acdf699a5c1c54233636c640ca89/README.md#lockstake)
	- Is it in scope or only diff? -- Most of the issues OOS, only diff:
	  - https://security.makerdao.com/liquidations-2.0
	  - Everything from the original [clipper](https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/fa4f6630afb0624d04a003e920b0d71a00331d98/src/clip.sol)
	- Readme inside repo (lockstake/README.md)
	  - [proxy-manager-clipper](https://github.com/makerdao/proxy-manager-clipper/blob/67b7b5661c01bb09d771803a2be48f0455cd3bd3/src/ProxyManagerClipper.sol) -- auctions for situations when collateral is deposited somewhere (e.g., compound)
		- https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip59-dsscharter/10028
	  - (used for [dss-crop-join](https://github.com/makerdao/dss-crop-join)). -- allows depositing collateral somewhere to get profit
		- DSS-Crop-join introduces support for new ilks with a join adapter facilitating the staking of the collateral tokens in a third-party system to generate rewards instead of simply holding the tokens at the join adapter. The generated reward is distributed amongst the users the collateral belongs to.
		- https://www.chainsecurity.com/security-audit/makerdao-dss-crop-join
		- https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip30-farmable-cusdc-adapter-cropjoin/5163
  - What did they even change? -- flux => slip, engine callbacks. Probably LSE will handle collateral after it is slipped (just change the gem amount)
	- Check diff
	  - flux vs slip -- move vs just update
		- vat.flux -- move gem (internal collateral balance) to another account. Checks for msg.sender or approved ^vat-flux
		- vat.slip -- just change gem (free collateral, not yet in any urn) balance, nothing else, authed ^vat-slip
	  - engine callbacks
  - Readme inside repo further
	- "sends the taker callee the collateral (MKR) in the form of ERC20 tokens and not `vat.gem`" What does it mean? -- Sends collateral to liquidator
	  - taker callee -- liquidator selects where to send collateral, taker=liquidator, callee=where(address)
	  - ERC20 vs vat.gem implications -- Probably just for convenience, no need to exit .gem to ERC20
	- exit fee -- 15% paid when withdrawing MKR (collateral)
	- "MKR (collateral) leftovers upon completion of the auction" -- dent phase can leave more collateral in an urn
	  - why and when is it left? -- Because of the `dent` phase
		- does it use the same auction as original DSS? -- Mostly yes, so first increase the DAI paid, then decrease collateral
		- do they sell 100% of collateral or what -- Same
	  - Is auction not for 100% of collateral -- According to [docs](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/dog-and-clipper-detailed-documentation#vault-liquidation) 100%, dog.bark 
	- "incentives for self-liquidation" which ones? -- Probably exit fee avoidance (but not sure if it's kept or not, see [[#^LSC--1-fee|1-fee]]), but maybe also to socialize bad debt, get rewards from protocol
	- ilk's liquidation ratio (`mat`) -- lower => can liquidate ^spot-ilk-mat
	  - how is it stored? -- 1.45e27
		- get mkr contract, spot?
		  - https://chainlog.makerdao.com/
			- spot https://etherscan.io/address/0x65c79fcb50ca1594b025960e539ed7a9a6d434a3#readContract#F1
			  - ETH 0x4554482d41000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 => 1.45 e27
			- ilk registry .list https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a464c28d19848f44199d003bef5ecc87d090f87#readContract#F11
	- `ink * price / mat = debt` -- 'collateral in ~USD scaled down by liquidation ratio = debt' is the limit, or debt scaled up by `mat` should be <= collateral
	- chop -- penalty in %, like 1.13
	- amt of collateral sold `debt * chop / price` -- debt in USD + fee in collateral tokens
	  - In which tokens is debt -- ~USD
	  - then why do we divide on price -- to get collateral amt
	- "Since we need to make sure that only up to `(1-fee)` of the total collateral is sold (where `fee` will typically be 15%), we require: `â‘¡ debt * chop / price < (1-fee) * ink`" ^LSC--1-fee
	  - Why (1-fee)? -- We need to keep the fee for the protocol, can't sell all the collateral? hmm
		- Where does the fee go? We just keep it on the protocol or can give to a liquidator too? --  [[#^LSC-take]] calls [[#^LSE-onRemove]], which seem to burn MKR `fee`
		- Why don't we send the fee somewhere on deposit if it's not a reward for liquidation? -- It's for an auction, but because of overcollateralization it will be probably left
		- Oh, `fee` is the Maker term here? -- Kind of, it's just exit fee, but also a `fee` variable
	  - `debt * chop / price < (1-fee) * ink` -- debt + liquidator premium < collateral available
		- Explanation: debt + liquidator premium < collateral available (without exit fee) (all in ~MKR) 
		  - debt -- debt in ~USD
		  - chop -- liquidator premium
		  - `debt * chop / price` -- debt + premium in collateral (~MKR)
		  - `(1-fee) * ink` -- collateral left after 15% fee
	- `mat > chop / (1 - fee)` -- mat covers both (liquidator bonus) * (exit fee)
	  - -->  > 1.18 * 1.13  (1/0.85 ~ 1.18)
	  - -->  > debt + (exit fee) + (liquidator bonus) 
	  - 1. Because debt limit is collateral scaled down by LTV
	  - 2. And debt + liquidator fee must be < collateral available
	  - chop -- liquidator bonus
	  - `chop / (1 - fee)` -- liquidator bonus * 1.18
	- `chip` - Percentage of tab to suck from vow to incentivize keepers. -- how much DAI to mint to keeper at the expense of vow (the system)
	  - tab -- DAI wanted from auction, DAI debt
	  - suck -- vat.suck: add the bad debt (in DAI) on u, give the same DAI to v ^vat-suck
		- Define -- add bad debt to u, mint `dai` to v, increase total bad debt and total `dai` 
		  - sin -- `[address => bad debt DAI]`
		  - dai -- `[address => balanceOf DAI]`
		  - vice -- total sin, total bad debt DAI
			- sin vs vice -- [] vs [].sum()
		  - debt -- dai.sum()
	  - vow -- debt and surplus counter
  - How does lsmkr move? ^Q--lsmkr-move
	- Where is it minted, and to whom:
	  - `LSE._lock`; -- to `urn`, user provided LSUrn, created by LSE
		- > `urn` must have `urnOwners[urn]` that is set only on LSE.open => `urn` is LockstakeUrn
		- LSE.lock <-X
		- LSE.lockNgt <-X
	  - LSE.onRemove; -- to liquidated `urn`
		- LSC.take <- X; to: liquidated `urn`
		  - to: `sales[id].usr`, id is `take`r provided ^Q--lsmkr-move--to-usr
			- `sales[id].usr` set on LSC.kick 
			  - called by dog.bark
				- `urn`, provided by caller/liquidator, liquidated `urn`
		  - Can we change .usr? -- no
			- Can we call .bark for the same urn? -- nope, id is ++ on each kick
			  - If price goes down again? -- nope, id = kick++
			- others -- no other changes
		- LSC.yank <- END.sol; to: same as in `take`, liquidated `urn`
	- Where is it burned and to whom:
	  - `LSE._free`; -- to: urn, user provided, but uses [[#^LSE-urnAuth]]
		- free
		- freeNgt
		- freeNoFee
	  - LSE.onKick: -- to: liquidated `urn`
		- LSC.kick
		  - to: same as [[#^Q--lsmkr-move--to-usr]]
	- Where is it approved and to whom
	  - LSUrn.init; -- to: LSE; amt: max
		- lsmkr.approve(msg.sender, type(uint256).max);
		  - who is msg.sender? -- LSE on LSE.open
	  - LSUrn.stake; -- to: user-selected `farm`, but gov approved; amt: all ink(MKR, collateral) on `urn`; or newly transferred MKR
		- `LSE._selectFarm`
		  - user provided, but from gov approved
		- `LSE._lock`
		  - to the same selected farm, additional funds
		- Approves using lsmkr.approve(farm, wad);
	- Where is it moved/transferred? -- only on farm, but it can only be called by LSUrn => LSE
	  - from LSUrn -- no lsMkr transfers
	  - by LSE -- no lsMkr transfers
	  - by farm -- safeTransfer from/to msg.sender
	  - possible to farm on some other address, then can withdraw some lsMKR?-- no, only on msg.sender
	- Can the user transfer/burn it or is it stored somewhere? -- it is stored on LSUrn or SR, that does not allow transfers or approvals (unless ...)
	- If we can move or burn lsMkr -- does not seem that we can
	  - [x] something will revert because it expects urn to have it?
		- [x] probably `take`
		- [x] other functions that burn/transfer
	- [[#^LSE--lsMkr-flow]]
- kick -- start an auction, withdraw MKR to LSE ^LSC-kick
    - Qs
      - "trusts the caller to transfer collateral to the contract", where does it happen? -- in dog.bark using vat.grab ^LSC-kick-Q-transfer
        - caller -- dog.bark
        - does dog.bark do it? -- yep
          - vat.grab? -- urn.ink(collateral) => `vat.gem[clip]`; urn.debtDai => vow; ^dog-bark--vat-grab
            - move user's (urn) collateral(gem) to clip(LSClipper) and DAI debt to system (vow); 
            - reduce urn's collateral and DAI debt, increase vow's surplus and bad debt in DAI
            - dog.bark pass args:
              - milk.clip -- auction address for this collateral
                - milk -- memory collateral struct
                - clip -- clipper(auction) address
              - vow -- debt/surplus ledger
              - dink -- diff collateral balance

            - dtab -- DAI wanted from auction
            - gem -- free collateral tokens
              - vat.gem vs urn.ink -- free collateral with locked in urn
            - sin -- `[address => bad debt DAI]`
            - vice -- total sin, total bad debt DAI
    - args
      - tab -- auction wanted total in DAI (usually the whole urn's debt) + penalty ^kick-tab
        - what? -- auction total in DAI (1e45) + penalty
          - Qs
            - "total dai wanted from the auction / total dai to be raised (in flip auction)"? -- so we replaced flip auctions with clip auctions and it looks like a clip auction
            - why "Debt" in comments? 
              - so we sell collateral (ETH) to cover debt (DAI). Probably how much debt we are ready to cover
          - how is it set in dog.bark -- DAI to liquidate + penalty ^dog--tab
            - `mul(due, milk.chop) / WAD;` -- DAI to liquidate + penalty
              - due = `mul(dart, rate);` -- DAI to liquidate
                - dart -- nDAI to liquidate (whole urn or system max) ^dog-bark--dart
                  - `dart1 = min(art, mul(room, WAD) / rate / milk.chop)` -- min(nDAI in urn, max nDAI allowed)
                    - art -- nDAI of an urn being liquidated
                      - vat.urns(ilk, urn);
                    - room/rate/chop -- max system limit of nDAI - liquidation penalty
                      - room -- how much DAI is allowed to be auctioned (hole-dirt)
                        - `min(Hole - Dirt, milk.hole - milk.dirt)` ^dog-hole-and-dirt
                          - milk.hole -- max DAI in auctions per collateral
                          - milk.dirt -- current DAI in auctions per collateral
                          - [Hole](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/dog-and-clipper-detailed-documentation#dog-hole-rad) -- max DAI in auctions total
                            - Dog.Hole -- [docs](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/dog-and-clipper-detailed-documentation#setting-hole-or-ilk.hole-too-high)Max DAI needed to cover debt + liquidation penalty of active auctions. `Hole = 10,000,000 * RAD` is 10M DAI.

                            - `dunk` -- set by governance, min amount of debt DAI to liquidate (either it or all vault's debt)
                              - minimum DAI liquidity requirement
                              - art -- normalized DAI debt 
                                - (normalized outstanding stablecoin debt.)
                            - `dunk` not used in Dog, can partially liquidate 
                      - rate -- multiplier to get DAI from art (nDAI)
                        - `(,rate, spot,, dust) = vat.ilks(ilk);`
                      - milk.chop -- liquidation penalty, e.g. 1.13
                - if (art > dart) -- not a full liquidation

                  - art - dart1 -- nDAI that can't be liquidated because of system limits
                  - rate -- nDAI to DAI conversion rate
                - `dart = art` -- if dust left add the dust. So Hole, .hole are not strict limits
              - rate -- nDAI to DAI converter
            - milk.chop -- liquidation penalty, e.g. 1.13. Profit for keeper and Vow
              - Goes to maker? Check code -- probably goes to vow, see [[#^milk-chop--does-go-to-maker]]
                - gpt: goes to keeper incentives, surplus goes to vow
                - it goes to `kick` in `tab`, so not sure
      - lot -- collateral amount proportional to tab, usually both 100% ^kick-lot
        - How is it set in dog.bark? -- usually 100%. proportional to nDAI debt amt liquidatable (hole - dirt) ^dog-bark--dink
          - `dink = mul(ink, dart) / art` = ink * dart / art = collateral proportional to liquidated nDAI amount. Usually all
            - ink -- collateral balance of an urn

      - Buy using what -- DAI, we buy collateral, paying DAI debt
      - Who supplies amt -- taker (user)
      - "if `amt` would cost more DAI than `tab` at the current price, the amount of collateral purchased will instead be just enough to collect `tab` DAI". ^LSC--C-owe-down
        - => if request too much `amt` will be limited to `tab` converted to collateral amount
          - if `amt` (requested collateral amount) would cost more DAI than `tab` (all debt + penalty), the amount of collateral purchased will instead be just enough to collect `tab`(debt + penalty all) DAI 
        - why "`tab` at the current price", isn't tab already set on kick -- tab can decrease when some collateral is bought + decrease with time

        - tab in DAI - auction total, usually the whole urn, if not too many auctions;

          - How is it possible -- ok, maybe if a calc is complicated and cannot only decrease, but also increase price, idk. Don't see in usual case
            - tab -- set on auction `kick`, can only decrease on each `take`

            - Where did we get the rest? -- on LSE.lock

                - why `WAD - fee`? -- like taxes, `sold` is post-tax. gross-up
                  - I remember I read about this formula somewhere
                    - Gross-up amount = desired net pay / (1 â€“ Tax Rate)

                    - how is fee set -- to a value < WAD
                    - what is WAD here, 1? -- yep, at least for fee
                    - let's say we sold 50%
                      - 0.5 * 0.15 / 0.85 = ~0.088 (burn)
                      - left 0.5
                      - refund 0.5 - 0.088 = 0.412
                    - I think it's like a tax, to get to $10k salary post-tax with 15% tax you need to have 10k * 0.15 / 1 - 0.15 = ~`$1.765k` more pre-tax. 11765 - 15% = ~10k
              - mkr.burn straightforward burn? -- yep, just checks for approval or msg.sender == from
                - is it old mkr or new? -- old
                  - see mkr = mkrNgt.mkr(); in LSE.constractor

	- Looks like otherwise user loses money somehow
	  - [scReadme](https://github.com/makerdao/sherlock-contest/blob/master/README.md) says: `wipeAll` and `wipe do not drip because it is actually not convenient for the user to do a drip call on wiping. Then, if we force the drip, we are incentivizing users to repay directly to the vat (which is possible) instead of using the engine for that. We are mimicking the old proxy actions behavior, where we drip for drawing, as otherwise the user can lose money, but not forcing the drip on wiping so users actually use this function.
	- Docs for [drip](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module/jug-detailed-documentation#drip)
	  - `drip(bytes32 ilk)` performs stability fee collection for a specific collateral type when it is called (note that it is a public function and may be called by anyone). `drip` does essentially three things:
		1. Calculates the change in the rate parameter for the collateral type specified by `ilk` based on the time elapsed since the last update and the current instantaneous rate (`base + duty`);
		2. Calls `Vat.fold` to update the collateral's `rate`, total tracked debt, and Vow surplus;
		3. Updates `ilks[ilk].rho` to be equal to the current timestamp.
  - `dart` -- usually diff in `art`, nDAI

				- and the second argument must be the empty byte string if no function should be called, 
				- making it impossible to invoke the `receive` function during an upgrade
		- onlyProxy -- not calling Implementation directly; `getImplementation` slot (on Proxy) returns `__self` => Proxy calls the expected Implementation
			- ! `address(this) == __self` (set in constructor, immutable, inside the code) -- not self call, direct implementation call
			- `ERC1967Utils.getImplementation() (= StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value)` != `__self` -- implementation slot on the proxy contract must be set to `__self` (embedded in Implementation code);
				- If the implementation you call, that knows its address, written inside the code, understands that it was called from a Proxy, it makes sense to revert if it thinks that calling the same address.
			- "Execution of a function through ERC1167 minimal proxies (clones) would not normally pass this test, but is not guaranteed to fail." Why not guaranteed? -- because `getImplementation` slot is not _usually_ set on 1167. A second check will return true, 0 != `__self`. But it can be set; nothing prohibits it.
				- `__self` is address1, e.g., 0x1
				- `StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value` is usually 0
				- => `address(this) == __self` false, 
					- `address(this)` = 0x2
					- `__self` == 0x1
					- 0x2 == 0x1 => false
				- => `ERC1967Utils.getImplementation() != __self` 
					- getImplementation == 0
					- `__self` == 0x1
					- 0 != 0x1 => true
		- Why do we need to validate `proxiableUUID` = slot address on upgrade?
			- If slots are different, then `onlyProxy` won't work 
		- "IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier."
			- Proxiable = Logic contract = implementation
			- "risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it"
				- Wrong: Proxy1 => Proxy2 => Logic
					- Original: Proxy => Logic
					- Proxy1 sets the implementation to Proxy2. 
			- "by delegating to itself until out of gas"
				- Oh, so Proxy1.slot is set to Proxy2.address
				- User => Proxy1 {storage} => Proxy2 {Logic}
				- User => P1.f1 => P1.fallback => P1.impl.f1 
					  => P2.f1 => P2.fallback => P2.impl.f1 (=P1.impl =P2) 
					  => P2.f1 =>... 
				- Proxy2.fallback is looking for the implementation slot, reads Proxy1.slot == Proxy2.address, calls Proxy2, gets to Proxy2.fallback again
			- "Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier."
					- User => P1.f1 => P1.fallback => P1.impl.f1 
					- (notDelegated)
						- `address(this) != __self` => true => revert
							- address(this) == P1
							- `__self` == P1.impl == P2
							- P1 != P2 => true => revert
		- `_upgradeToAndCallUUPS` calls `proxiableUUID`
			- User => P1.utac(P2) => P2.proxiableUUID => P2.`_checkNotDelegated`
				- `address(this)` == P2
				- `__self` = C3
				- P2 != C3 => true => revert
			- User => P1.utac(C3) => C3.proxiableUUID => C3.`_checkNotDelegated`

			- [docs](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/core-module/vat-detailed-documentation#vault-management) -- can be canceled with `dai` on `vow`
				- Sin represents "seized" or "bad" debt and can be canceled out with an equal quantity of DAI using `heal(uint rad)` where `msg.sender` is used as the address for the `dai` and `sin` balances.
					- **Note:** Only the Vow will ever have `sin`, so only the Vow can successfully call `heal`. This is because whenever `grab` and `suck` are called, the Vow's address is passed as the recipient of `sin`. Note that this is contingent on the current design and implementation of the system.
					- **Note:** `heal` can only be called with a positive number (uint) and will `sub(dai[u])` along with `sub`ing the `sin`.
			- How does `dai` get on `vow`? -- jug.drip
				- **System Surplus:** Occurs from stability fee accumulation, resulting in additional internal DAI in the `Vow`. [docs](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/system-stabilizer-module/vow-detailed-documentation#id-3.-key-mechanisms-and-concepts)

					- To protect against bespoke token implementations that can update the pair contractâ€™s balance, and to more gracefully handle tokens whose total supply can be greater than 2112, Uniswap v2 has two bail-out functions: sync() and skim().
					- sync() functions as a recovery mechanism in the case that a token asynchronously deflates the balance of a pair. In this case, trades will receive sub-optimal rates, and if no liquidity provider is willing to rectify the situation, the pair is stuck. sync() exists to set the reserves of the contract to the current balances, providing a somewhat graceful recovery from this situation.

	- `_getDaiToSell` formula -- looks like you need to go too deep and solve a system ^FlapperUniV2-formula
		- CGpt: 
			~~~
			Certainly, I'll explain how the formula in the `_getDaiToSell` function was derived. Let's break it down step by step:
			
			1. First, let's recall the two equations mentioned in the comments:
			
			   (1) reserveDai * reserveGem = (reserveDai + sell * 997 / 1000) * (reserveGem - bought)
			   (2) (lot - sell) / bought = (reserveDai + sell) / (reserveGem - bought)
			
			2. These equations represent the Uniswap invariant and the ratio of reserves after the swap, respectively.
			
			3. To solve for `sell`, we need to eliminate `bought` from these equations and solve for `sell`.
			
			4. From equation (2), we can express `bought` in terms of other variables:
			   bought = (lot - sell) * (reserveGem - bought) / (reserveDai + sell)
			
			5. Substituting this into equation (1):
			   reserveDai * reserveGem = (reserveDai + sell * 997 / 1000) * (reserveGem - (lot - sell) * (reserveGem - bought) / (reserveDai + sell))
			
			6. This equation is quite complex, but it can be simplified and rearranged into a quadratic equation in terms of `sell`.
			
			7. After simplification and rearrangement (which involves several algebraic steps), we get a quadratic equation of the form:
			   a * sell^2 + b * sell + c = 0
			
			   Where:
			   a = 1994
			   b = 1997 * reserveDai
			   c = -reserveDai * (lot * 3988000 + reserveDai * 3988009)
			
			8. The solution to this quadratic equation is given by the quadratic formula:
			   sell = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
			
			9. Substituting the values of a, b, and c:
			   sell = (-1997 * reserveDai + sqrt((1997 * reserveDai)^2 - 4 * 1994 * (-reserveDai * (lot * 3988000 + reserveDai * 3988009)))) / (2 * 1994)
			
			10. Simplifying this expression (factoring out reserveDai from under the square root):
				sell = (sqrt(reserveDai * (lot * 3988000 + reserveDai * 3988009)) - reserveDai * 1997) / 1994
			
			This is exactly the formula we see in the `_getDaiToSell` function:
			
			```solidity
			sell = (Babylonian.sqrt(reserveDai * (lot * 3_988_000 + reserveDai * 3_988_009)) - reserveDai * 1997) / 1994;
			```
			
			The `Babylonian.sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root, and the constants have been slightly adjusted (3_988_000 instead of 3988000) for readability, but the formula is essentially the same.
			
			This derivation involves complex algebraic manipulations and simplifications, which is why the resulting formula looks quite different from the original equations. The goal was to find an efficient way to calculate the amount of DAI to sell given the lot size and the current DAI reserve.
